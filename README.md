Module 6 Serverside API Challenge 06
This weeks Module challenge was to make a 5 day weather forecast using the https://openweathermap.org/api along with an API key. I struggled plenty with this even having the help of my tutor my instructor and the BCS assistants. its not fully functional but you can add in your own city and it will store the history in the console log in DEV tools. Also i wasnt able to find the icons I originally used when i started the project.
